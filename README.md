# A simple json deserializer
which I built over a couple of days in order to understand:
- Tree traversal
- Deserializing
- Overall software architecture

## Completion
It is complete, though there's a major bug where if a key character is entered somewhere, it is parsed as a key character.

## Disclaimer
It assumes a valid json file.
